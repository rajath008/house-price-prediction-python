# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on various features such as its size, number of rooms, location, etc.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and other relevant attributes(In this case Chicago Houses Dataset). The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

## Model Training

The house price prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) to learn patterns and relationships between the house features and their corresponding prices. The training process involves feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Evaluation

To assess the performance of the trained model, various evaluation metrics are used, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score. These metrics help measure the accuracy and generalization capability of the model.
